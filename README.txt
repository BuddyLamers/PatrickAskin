A responsive portfolio site for Actor and Writer Patrick Askin.

Features a flat, minimalistic design, a fully animated 
interface (with noscript fallbacks), and styling for all basic page elements (including 
blockquotes, tables and lists). 

Optimizations:
* Load CSS in header, and JS files in footer
* For YouTube: instead of using iframe, load a static image with an overlayed "play" icon which then loads the actual video
